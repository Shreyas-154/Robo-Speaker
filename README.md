# Robo-Speaker
This is a simple Python script that converts text into speech using the pyttsx3 library. The program takes user input and speaks it out loud. It can be used for voice interaction, text-to-speech applications, or fun projects involving speech synthesis.

The script runs in a loop, allowing continuous input until the user enters 'q' to quit. The speech engine properties such as speech rate and volume are customizable.
